This Repository contains Session for some Algorithms and Tips & Tricks for PS and CP

If you want some templates for algorithms in CP you can use [mine](https://github.com/7oSkaaa/CP-Templates.git)

If you want a good roadmap for practicing problem solving, use Mostafa Saad's [Junior sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iJZWP2nS_OB3kCTjq8L6TrJJ4o-5lhxDOyTaocSYc-k/edit#gid=84654839), and try [Weal Ahmed add-on](https://github.com/Waelahmed99/junior-sheet-add-on) to make it easier <br> 

If you don't know what competitive programming is, head to [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8OxKsmAyrGAfBiluhpLkbA) and start practicing now!
