## Problems

### Thinking Problems

1. Stuck in thinking
2. Panic
3. Rush
4. Distraction (Whats app, Mobile,..., etc)

### Solving Problems

1. Ir-responsive reading
2. Not paying attention to constrains
3. Lack of knowledge (Algorithms)
4. Not enough practicing
5. Can't debug or maintain code after wrong answer
6. Not paying attention to tricky test cases, corner testcases and overflow.
7. Wrong training plan
8. Slow writing
9. Doesn't know enough syntax for the language
10. Stuck on a single algorithm or idea
11. Reading the problem once
12. Not focusing on the main idea of the problem
13. Overthinking the problem

### Training Problems

1. No priorities
2. Random practicing
3. Solve problems not your level
4. Not asking for help
5. Solving problems without studying algorithms/topics
6. Little practice
7. Give the problem much time than it deserves

## Solution for these problems

1. Set your priorities
2. Make plans that suits your goals
3. Be convinced by your level
4. Don't rush
5. Read the statement carefully more than one time
6. Focus on the constraints (there are a problems solve by it's constraints)
7. **Think on paper not PC!**
8. Write Clean Code
9. Test your code (tricky test - corner test - overflow test)
10. Practice typing on keyboard
11. Compete yourself not others
12. **Never Give Up!**
13. Study more algorithms
14. Practice a lot, it's worth it

## Plans for practicing

### Speed

- Solve a lot of problems with rate less than your level on a predetermined time.
- Use timer to maintain your speed
- Practice typing speed
- Practice on getting the main point from the problem faster every time
  
### Increase your level

- Study and practice more algorithms
- Solve hard problems, read its editorial
- Read the editorial of the problems
- Read the solutions of others after solving the problem
- Up-solve the problems that you stuck in during the contest

### Increase your rate

- Take part in a lot of contests
- Enter a lot of virtual contests
- Focus on speed and don't panic
- Increasing your typing speed
- Up-solve the problems that you stuck in the contest
- Solve problems with rate higher than your rate
- Train on solving the problem you couldn't solve during live contests (e.g. div2 B problems)
- Study common algorithms
- Practice more on algorithms
- Solve hard ad-hoc problems (implementation, math, greedy, brute-force)
- Be faster, Be faster, and Be faster
